# WordGame
## Requirements of game
### Using vectors or arrays, backtracking, other required algorithms and Object Oriented programming practices create the following game.

Fun With Letters / Integers - is a game that uses a 4 x 4 board to solve the following requirements:

- no two letters or numbers can lie in the same vertical / horizontal or diagonal. (use templates)

- different (non-duplicated) letters or numbers either as 4 letter words or 4 numbers (like: bark, bank, card or 1234, 4567, 6789)

- pull different number or letter combinations from a file. Write your code so that each new game pulls a different combination.  Fill your file with 20 words / 20 number combos.

- allow the user to decide whether they want to use a letter or number combo.

- create the program so that the user plays the game.  You have determined the correct sequence and then check it as the user enters values into a 2D game board.

- display the game board as a 2D ascii representation.  

- allow user to enter values based on row / col combinations like first square is 0,0 - store current game conditions

- allow user to continue or quit as they progress placing the values on the board

- when game board is full - allow user to decide to quit to check results.

- display final stats.  If they got it right - tell them - if wrong display correct results.

- comment code - heavily

- error check code 100% - don't allow any errors in user entry and game logic

- submit final code here with screen shots of it working and final code.

## My additional features
- Colors in game (to know entered number, reamaining number and hints)
- Ability to choose between restart, reload
- Win/Defeat screen
- Optimized algrotihm (kinda based on nQueens problem)
